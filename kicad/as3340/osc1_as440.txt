Functionality

Input & Output

* Output two mixes based on available waveforms on pins 1 & 2
* Mix1: enable/disable triangle (MIX1_TRI_CTRL), saw (MIX1_SAW_CTRL), pulse (MIX1_PULSE_CTRL), comp of osc1 saw and osc2 (MIX1_COMP_OUT)
* Mix2: enable/disable triangle (MIX2_TRI_CTRL), saw (MIX2_SAW_CTRL), pulse (MIX2_PULSE_CTRL), comp of osc1 saw and osc2 (MIX2_COMP_OUT)
* Level of pulse signal through VCA (PULSE_VCA_LEVEL_DAC)



* Output Osc1 CV on pin 3 (FREQ_CV_DAC)

Modulation

* Osc pitch via FREQ_CV_DAC
* PWM via PWM_DAC
* Linear FM via LINEAR_FM_DAC, enabled via LINEAR_FM_CV_CTRL

Modulation via external in:
* External in: option of using Osc2 mix1 or Osc2 mix2 from pins 6 or 7
** External in optionally switched (HARD_SYNC_CTRL) into hard sync comparator
** Sync comparator negative reference switches (SYNC_REF_CTRL) either generated CV (SYNC_LEVEL_DAC) or osc1 3340 triangle
** External in processed through VCA with level set via CV signal (OSC_EXT_AMOUNT_DAC) (for PWM & FM only, not sync)
** Exponential FM via external scaled signal (EXP_FM_EXT_CTRL)
** External scaled input PWM control (EXT_MOD_PW_CTRL)
